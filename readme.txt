We are David Naist Øvernes & Umaer Malik, Markus Fenes.
We made a web site for an assignment; this is how our web site came to life. 
We used IDEOs (design thinking) to come up with ideas for the site.

We gathered many ideas, wrote them down, and picked out the ones we liked. 
This was how we found out what company to make a site for, 
we went from a site for doctors to the sports sites and then many ideas later,
 we landed on a games company. Then we had find/make a name for it, 
and it became ICESTORM Interactive, and 
then we started to come up with designs for the site and
 we found one we all liked, and so it was developed from there. 

What our product and company does. 

Our site is for a game developer/publisher, this is a medium size company, and our products are games, 
and the platform we have made, called ChilledNet. We have six games on our site.
In addition, there are possibilities for expansions. The site is also a storefront for our games, 
with the possibilities of buying it. 

The features

Since responsive design was a requirement from the start on this task, 
so our site was made with it. Responsive meaning it will scale on the user’s devices resolution, 
and because of same reasons, it was designed on phones first. 
The scaling is made possible using media query, at three predefined levels, phone, tablet, and laptop. 
The site is made with a header & navigation bar, a main part and a footer. 
In the header, we have a navigation bar, which is on all the sites at the top,
it changes form on mobile devices to fit the screen resolution. 

The main part of the site is home to the pictures and paragraphs that describe the games
and what our company does. The front page also features a slider that shows our games.  
In the bottom, there is another much smaller navigation bar, and some copyright info.
There are four normal pages (home, about, work and contact), 
with content on, and six game sites with different games.

Technologies used 

On this project, we have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 
We have also used Font Awesome, Fonts from Google Fonts and Google Maps inside an iframe, 
the google map has a geolocation feature to it.  
We have used some JavaScript, the slider on the front-page uses it; 
the geolocation uses it, and some other features.   

Colours

The colours and the fonts are the same thru the whole website. 
Same with the design choices, since this is one of the biggest practices in the industry. 
Our colours are Snow (#F9F9F9), Water (#004CFF) this is for the text and borders on the site, 
the menus and the buttons are using the colour Blueberry (#00357F). 
At last, the background uses the colour navy (#000D21).
